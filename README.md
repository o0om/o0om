## About Me

I'm a software developer with a strong focus on Python and practical experience across more than 16 programming languages. I specialize in building custom tooling and backend systems with an emphasis on performance, low-level control, and maintainability.

My most notable project to date is a fully custom implementation of a Discord API wrapper written in Python â€” developed entirely without relying on existing libraries like `discord.py`.

## Featured Project

### [Serenity API Wrapper](https://github.com/o0om/Serenity-Api-Wrapper/tree/master/discord)

A fully custom implementation of the Discord API written in Python. This project avoids all existing wrappers and libraries, providing direct interaction with both the REST API and WebSocket Gateway.

**Key Features:**

- Manual REST and Gateway handling
- Native support for interactions and slash commands
- Precise control over rate limits and payload handling
- Built entirely with `asyncio` and `aiohttp`
- Structured, modular, and written with type safety in mind

> This project demonstrates full-stack bot infrastructure development at the protocol level.
